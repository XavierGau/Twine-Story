They are asking you, someone with no training or experience, to be responsible for the life of the person in that building. You are a nobody, you didn’t ask to be here, in fact you were told you had to be. If you left, you would be &#39;the reason for that person’s fucking death,&#39; the officer had said to you.  

You were only doing your job, working at the register of a petrol station a hundred kilometres from the nearest town. Truckers and farmers passed through regularly, but not much else. Before today, the most eventful moment you had experienced working here was farmer Wilson’s cattle dog breaking free from his leash on the tray of his ute.  

Earlier today, your life was changed forever. He had entered the station with his hood on, you noticed the smell before looking up from your phone. His eyes were sunken back into his face, white earphone cables tucked into his hoodie.  

The only other person in the station was a truckie you had not seen before; he was tall, bearded, and had tatts down to his knuckles.  

The hooded man pulled a gun on you first. Judging by his expression, you don’t think he noticed the truckie immediately. He jumped with he saw the much larger man standing to his side.

He stuttered over his words; you didn’t know what he wanted. You told him to take anything, the money, the food, whatever he wanted. He told you to ring the police. 

You looked at him, shocked and confused.

In the coming hours, you understood why. He had no interesting in money or objects, he only had interest for you. You, and the truckie, were his hostages.  

When the police had arrived, they had negotiated for you to be released in exchange for them to move their cars further back from the station. You were released, free to go, but the truckie remained.  

Although the police were able to negotiate your release, it came with a price. The man now refuses to speak with anyone but you, and he won’t use the phone to talk.  

You must negotiate the safe release of the hostage, in person.  

You:

As you approach the station, you feel your knees buckling. The weight of what you&#39;re about to do hits you like the truck that is still parked outside.

&quot;Do-Don&#39;t! Stop there!&quot; The voice comes from the station, it sounds terrified. For a moment, you think it might be the truck driver, but through the window you see the hooded man holding his gun at the floor, where you assume the hostage is lying.

&quot;Laurence,&quot; he says, almost annoyed that you&#39;ve asked him.

&quot;Why are you doing this, Laurence?&quot; You ask.

&quot;I don&#39;t have a choice,&quot; he replies.

You don&#39;t know what else to say, so you just say it.

&quot;You need to stop. You need to let him go. You&#39;re just making things worse for yourself,&quot; you tell him.

&quot;I can&#39;t. You don&#39;t know. I&#39;m too far in,&quot; he replies.

You realise that the only way to make him stop is to make him feel hopeless, that there is no way to win. You have the upper hand and it&#39;s about time you tell him that.

You reach into your jacket and pull out the gun. Before you can even raise the gun towards the window, a shot rings out from the station. You see for a second, the look of utter shock on the face of the man. He looks down at the ground, and immediately another deafening bang pierces your ears. The man collapses to the ground after raising the gun to his own head.

&quot;I&#39;m not moving until you get it done,&quot; he says. 

He gestures for you to go back to the police officers. You slowly walk backwards towards them, being careful not to startle him. 

The officers tell you that it will take time to get his brother here and you need to stall. If you leave him for long without knowing what&#39;s going on, he might start to panic. 

You feel the sun burning your neck as you stand outside the station again, trying to think of what to tell him. You weren&#39;t even sure the truck driver was still alive, he could have killed him with one of the knives in the station and you&#39;d have no idea.

His demeanor changes completely, for a second it looks almost hopeless. His shoulders relax and he looks to the side. You can see him losing touch with reality. Something triggers in him and he snaps back to you, shooting at you. Two shots hit the concrete next to you and one cuts into you lower leg.

You back up towards the police cars(if:(history: where its name contains &quot;Accept their offer&quot;)&#39;s length is 1)[ again], keeping your eyes on him as you do. They tell you that they are confident to breach now that they know where the hostage is, and that you did you job well.

You are instructed to stand back as the S.W.A.T. team push behind the station. You hear screaming from the building as tear gas fills it to the brim. 

You hear over the radio that the hostage and the man are subdued, everything went well. 

You feel the relief of everyone around you. You stand there, still in shock about the whole situation. It feels surreal and you&#39;re not sure that will ever change.
